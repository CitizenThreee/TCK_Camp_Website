Third Culture Kids share much in common: ironically, a lot of our commonality comes from having little in common with everyone else around us. But, as much as TCKs form something of a cultural group of our own, weâ€™re all on individual journeys and are at different stages of life. One person might be 16 years old and have a full knowledge of where they want to go next, while another might be 19 and struggling to fit into life here with no idea what they want to do.",
