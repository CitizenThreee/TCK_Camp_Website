From ancient times, sea travel has been part of how we’ve explored, traded, and built relationships across the globe. But here’s the thing - every ship and waka needs an anchor. Not to hold us back, but to give us stability between the adventures. \n It’s the same with the TCK journey. Travel’s been a huge part of life, but so have the anchors that keep us steady - like the love and faithfulness of God, the wider mission whānau that surrounds us, our extended families, and even the kai that can feel unfamiliar one day and after some time, it warms the heart as well as the belly. \n The truth is, we have anchors. And it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on what keeps us steady in the times and places of change. Let's celebrate the anchors that actually help us move forward, across oceans and cultures. The journey goes on!",
